The code for this outscored while i work on other part  and also they all work well thos  it's unfinished , it runs, but the features still need to be integrated together in a coherent way.

# Package desriptions

## remaing things TODO

- Switch the react backend to a [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) backend
- Add a suitable homepage to the dashboard. I used [Clearbit's](https://clearbit.com/risk) for inspiration
- Train a logistic regression model on credit card fraud data. [Here's](https://github.com/nickwalker037/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection) an example repository. 
- Integrate 2 [Openmined](https://github.com/OpenMined) libraries, PySyft, and syft.js into the app to enable federated learning and secure multiparty computation.
